#  Helm To Kustomize

## Why helm is not declarative

The idea behind declarative infrastructure is that what you define is what gets set up on your system when you are talking about helm there is a tendency to believe that specifying a value.yaml file is being "declarative" however the main problem is that these values get injected into templates at runtime, meaning there is an opportunity for divergence if the templates change. Also, the templates aren't generally kept in the same repo as the values.yaml so when trying to figure out what is being deployed you have to go chart hunting. 

*"Look at that beautiful helm template"* said nobody, ever

This speaks volumes as let's face it Helm templates are complex and very hard to figure out what is going on.

## The hard to argue upside to Helm

So the question is why use helm then? Well believe it or not putting together all the resources needed for an application (deployments, service, ingress, validation hooks etc) is a lot of work. My default nginx-ingress install has 11 resources. Remembering all that for each application is difficult, then you start including all the configurable properties (env, args, commands etc) it's almost impossible to do this every time. This is where helm shines, it allows to set "sensible" defaults that are configurable via the values if needed.  Making installing most applications very simple, however this comes with a downside, upfront visibility and transparency is lost, you don't generally figure out what a helm chart has installed until it is up and running on your cluster, making for huge security problems (the same security issues that you can get when installing pip or npm packages).


## The Way forward

So what is the way forward, we want to keep the awesome magic of Helm but at the same time, if we want to use methodologies like GitOps, we need a more declarative way. This is where I suggest using both Helm and Kustomize in conjunction with each other. Helm has a handy templating feature that allows you to template out all the resource that you can then easily specify in a Kustoomize base, the steps are straight forward

## Step 1: Helm Fetch

Fetch the chart as helm template needs it locally to template out the yaml

```bash
helm fetch \
--untar \
--untardir charts \
stable/nginx-ingress
```


## Step 2: Helm Template

Template out the yaml into a file, this is the step where you add the values to the chart and also set the namespace (more on this later)

```bash
helm template \
--name ingress-controller \
--output-dir base \
--namespace ingress \
--values values.yaml \
charts/nginx-ingress
```

This should give you a folder with a whole bunch of Kubernetes resources:

```bash
ls -l base/nginx-ingress/templates/

-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   1.0K Sep 24 08:44 clusterrole.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   510B Sep 24 08:44 clusterrolebinding.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   2.5K Sep 24 08:44 controller-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   690B Sep 24 08:44 controller-hpa.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   1.4K Sep 24 08:44 controller-role.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   500B Sep 24 08:44 controller-rolebinding.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   602B Sep 24 08:44 controller-service.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   273B Sep 24 08:44 controller-serviceaccount.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   1.6K Sep 24 08:44 default-backend-deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   541B Sep 24 08:44 default-backend-service.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 spazzy  staff   288B Sep 24 08:44 default-backend-serviceaccount.yaml
```

just to neaten things up lets move these up a dir and delete the template dir:

```bash
mv base/nginx-ingress/templates/* base/nginx-ingress && rm -rf base/nginx-ingress/templates
```

## Step 3: create the Kustomization config

One thing that is not very well known is that helm does not handle namespaces very well, when you define `--namespace` while running `helm install` tiller does all the namespace work at runtime, it does not actually specify the namespace on any of the resources, meaning that in order to be more declarative you will need to create you namespace config manually:

```bash
cat <<EOF > base/nginx-ingress/namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ingress
EOF
```

You will need to create a `kustomization.yaml` that lists all your resources, this is probably the most time-consuming part as this 
will require you to go through the resources, you can also add some common labels etc.

```bash
 cat <<EOF > base/nginx-ingress/kustomization.yaml
 namespace: "ingress"
 commonLabels:
     roles: routing
 resources:
 - namespace.yaml
 - clusterrole.yaml
 - clusterrolebinding.yaml
 - controller-deployment.yaml
 - controller-hpa.yaml
 - controller-role.yaml
 - controller-rolebinding.yaml
 - controller-service.yaml
 - controller-serviceaccount.yaml
 - default-backend-deployment.yaml
 - default-backend-service.yaml
 - default-backend-serviceaccount.yaml
EOF
```


## Step 4: Apply your new base to a cluster

as of Kubectl 1.14, Kustomize is integrated therefore you can simply run:

```
kubectl apply -k base/nginx-ingress
```

## Conclusion
Yes this is a lot more work than just running `helm install`,  however the transparency you gain is worth it, as in any system you dont want any unknowns lurking in the dark. Once you have grasped this concept I would suggesting going to have a look at GitOps, this will change the way you handle operations.
